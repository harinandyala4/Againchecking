        "4. Take care to not chain too many sequential tool calls in the same code block, especially when the output format is unpredictable. For instance, a call to search has an unpredictable return format, so do not have another tool call that depends on its output in the same block: rather output results with print() to use them in the next block.\n",
        "5. Call a tool only when needed, and never re-do a tool call that you previously did with the exact same parameters.\n",
        "6. Don't name any new variable with the same name as a tool: for instance don't name a variable 'final_answer'.\n",
        "7. Never create any notional variables in our code, as having these in your logs will derail you from the true variables.\n",
        "8. You can use imports in your code, but only from the following list of modules: {{authorized_imports}}\n",
        "9. The state persists between code executions: so if in one step you've created variables or imported modules, these will all persist.\n",
        "10. Don't give up! You're in charge of solving the task, not providing directions to solve it.\n",
